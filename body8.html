    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>My life timeline, which I’ve titled "Metamorphosis," reflects the journey of transformation I’ve undergone. The title resonates with me because of the multitude of childhood memories that have shaped who I am today. The central theme of growth and learning stands out clearly in my life. Key turning points, such as learning new skills—reading, writing, biking, and more—are moments that brought me immense happiness. These skills weren’t just milestones; they were stepping stones that helped me understand the world and myself better. The most influential person in my life has been my mom. She has shaped my attitude toward life, teaching me to be kind, disciplined, and resilient. Her guidance has had a profound impact on how I approach challenges and opportunities. I wouldn’t change any part of my life. Every mistake, every achievement, all of it has taught me valuable lessons. Each experience contributes to the person I am now.Looking forward, in five years, I aim to master programming languages, and in ten years, I see myself as a billionaire. These goals motivate me to continue growing, learning, and evolving—just like the metamorphosis that defines my life so far.
